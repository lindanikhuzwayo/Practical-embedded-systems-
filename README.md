Problem: This prac is about using an ADC to digitize an analogue signal, the analogue signal being a voltage corresponding to the current sensed temperature as well as a light reading. It will require you to configure some basic interfacing aspects before integrating them all into the final program to digitize the temperature signal

Follow the prac's report providing more details about the solution 
partner : Marvin Kangangi

A demo vid is provided where we explain the fuction of the implementation 
Link to the repo with code : Marvin's git (Will include the code on this repo later)
